### Features:

##### \* one-on-one chat feature.

##### \* group chat feature I try to use redis pubsub but it makes more sense when we have more than one instance of the server (when we need to scale it for user).

##### \* video call feature using media soup sfu (selective forwarding unit) coming soon.
