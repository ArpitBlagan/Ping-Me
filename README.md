## Ping-Me an Chat app using ws and Mediasoup library ðŸš€.

##### The application leverages the ws library to enable WebSocket communication, providing users with a seamless and instant messaging experience.

> MERN + Typescript + Zod + AWS-S3.

### Features:

##### \* one-on-one chat feature.

##### \* group chat feature I try to use redis pubsub but it makes more sense when we have more than one instance of the server.

##### \* video call feature using media soup sfu (selective forwarding unit).
